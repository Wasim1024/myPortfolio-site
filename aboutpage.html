        My story? <br>
        I like putting a soul into every project, weaving creativity and code to tell a brand's tale 
        with a wink and a smile. My purpose drives me: to create meaningful designs that resonate, connect, 
        and leave users grinning a bit. Let's collaborate and design something that makes the internet 
        a prettier, happier place.</h2></section></main>
